## Rules
*Rules are accessible in-game through /rules*

*If you have been previously banned, you can appeal your ban [here](https://forms.gle/gwFiECrDKNiJwLzH8).*

### GENERAL RULE-SET[GR]
Rules that apply across all of Yukkuricraft

1. **Be courteous and respectful**
   
   Keep an open mind on the server and respect that others may see things differently to you. Do
   not engage in toxic behavior. In this server, toxicity is defined as intentional actions of a
   non-humorous nature aimed at causing distress or emotional/social harm towards others.
   Continuing toxic behavior will lead to proper punishment.

   In addition, continuous aggravating/annoying behavior directed towards a significant part of the
   server, that stretches or comes close to breaking server rules, will be treated as toxic
   behavior.

2. **Respect staff**
   
   Staff members volunteer their time in order to support the server. Please give staff members the
   same courtesy and respect you offer towards others both online and offline, and remember that
   they attempt to consider all issues and disputes from as objective a viewpoint as possible.
   Staff members have the final say on most server matters.

3. **Do not create or share R18 content outside of designated spaces**
   
   YC's minimum age limit is 13, so be aware when minors are present. Furthermore,
   ero-rp is strictly forbidden due to risks of activity with minors, which is against U.S. law.


4. **Do not ask for promotions**
   
   Promotions to staff are administered as per the server's requirement. The highest non-staff rank
   attainable is Elder, which is obtained by being a continuing positive contributor to the
   server's social development. While asking for information or offering to help is fine, demanding
   a promotion will impact poorly on your character.

5. **No account fraud/Ban evasion**
   
   Any attempts at ban evasion, account stealing/hijacking, or otherwise impersonating another
   community member for personal gain or any other reason will result in a permanent ban.

6. **No Soliciting**
   
   Unwarranted solicitations, attempts at spam, or inappropriate self-advertisement are not
   allowed. Aggressively or constantly nagging people about something you want them to do or join
   will not be tolerated. This rule is more strict on those not involved with the community, so
   spacing your advertisements out will not keep you clear of violating this rule if it's the only
   thing you do with us.

7. **SlOw RiDe TaKe It EaSy**
   
   At the end of the day, we're all just here to enjoy ourselves. The rules, while not concrete and
   are subject to change or working around if necessary, are simply put here to protect the good
   people and keep out the bad. So, please, remember to have fun and take it easy.

### SERVER RULE-SET[SR]
Rules that apply mostly to the Minecraft server.

1. **Do not grief**

   Griefing or stealing of items is strictly prohibited, aside from consensual activity with friends.

2. **Do not PvP**

   Unwarranted attacks against non-consenting players is forbidden. Dueling or ambushing your 
   friends is fine, but hunting strangers and other non-consensual PvP is not.

3. **Do not cheat**

   Do not use any software or exploits that may result in you gaining an unfair advantage over
   other players. Minimaps and waypoints, however, are permitted so long as the user does not abuse
   them.

4. **Be mindful when building**
   
   Builds that conflict with the existing environment, or are obviously low-effort, will be removed
   where appropriate.

5. **Don't abuse events and resources**

   Intentionally manipulating or exploiting server events and resources to gain material and items
   is illegal. This includes but is not limited to the likes of massive farms, bots, and/or
   exploiting event areas for drops.

#### RemiCare
The Remicare act is an active power provided to the community that allows them to claim abandoned builds
in the survival world.

If a user has not logged on in over 90 days, their builds become viable for Remicare. You can request
staff to investigate the build and confirm the user has been inactive for the timeframe, then give
ownership of the build to you. Logging in exclusively to avoid Remicare will not be counted.
			
Elders and up are entirely immune to Remicare. If a user below Elder rank suspects they will be gone for
longer than the 90 day period, they can inform staff and they will be protected for the estimated time
period. These protections can be overridden under specific circumstances.
			
Remicare is not guaranteed under any circumstances. This power is NOT to be abused, it is for
situational uses only. Users attempting to exploit this system for loot by seeking out abandoned builds
and/or nagging staff for remicare will be denied and potentially punished.

### DISCORD RULE-SET[DR]
Rules that apply mostly to the Discord server

1. **Be mindful of your microphone**
   
   If your sound quality is poor, please use the TTS role to communicate. Excessive hot-mic
   (constant microphone activity, such as background noise or your breathing/chewing/etc) may also
   result in you being requested to use the role. In general, please be courteous and don't
   constantly disturb the flow of conversation, whether the problem is hardware, software, or
   yourself. Continuing offenders will be warned and potentially banned.

2. **No NSFW without consent**
   
   If all members of a room with a temporary chat channel consent to viewing NSFW material, NSFW
   material can be posted. However, once a new member joins the room the process must be repeated.
   NSFW anywhere else, apart from NSFW channels, is prohibited.

### Closing notes
Remember that communication is vital to a healthy community. Most problems can be easily resolved by
talking it out, rather than starting drama or trying to get someone banned over nothing. Staff are here
to help, not be contracted hit-men for whomever you currently dislike. Treat your fellow member with the
same respect you'd like for yourself and remember to take it easy.
